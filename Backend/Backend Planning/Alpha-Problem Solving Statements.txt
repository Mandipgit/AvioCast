1. First: Let’s clarify the real problem you are solving

You are NOT trying to replace airline flight dispatch systems (those are extremely complex and regulated).

You are building a Passenger Awareness App that:

Shows weather conditions:

Origin airport (e.g. Kathmandu)

Destination airport (e.g. Biratnagar)

Alternate airport (e.g. Bhadrapur)

Gives a simple probability / risk indicator like:

✅ Likely to operate

⚠️ Risk of delay

❌ High chance of cancellation/diversion

👉 This is 100% achievable for a student project.

2. Reality check (important)
❌ What you should NOT promise

“Exact flight prediction”

“Guaranteed cancellation/operation”

✅ What you CAN say

“Weather-based risk estimation”

“Passenger decision support tool”

“Weather awareness for Nepal aviation”

This keeps your project ethical, realistic, and impressive.

3. Overall System Architecture (Simple & Clean)
Flutter App (Frontend)
       |
       |  REST API
       ↓
FastAPI Backend
       |
       |  Weather API
       ↓
Weather Data Provider

4. Weather APIs (Free vs Paid – Beginner Friendly)
✅ Best option for you: OpenWeatherMap

Why?

Free tier available

Easy to use

Good documentation

Works well with FastAPI

Free plan gives you:

Current weather

Forecast (5 days)

Parameters you need:

Visibility

Wind speed

Cloud coverage

Rain

Temperature

Pressure

🔗 You’ll just need to sign up and get an API key.

👉 Yes, it is FREE to start. Paid only if traffic increases.

❌ Advanced aviation APIs (NOT for beginners)

METAR / TAF paid services

AviationWeather.gov (complex parsing)

ICAO data feeds

You can add these later if you want to upgrade.

5. What weather factors affect flights in Nepal (Simplified)

For your first version, use ONLY these 5 👇

Factor	Why it matters
Visibility	Major issue in Nepal
Wind speed	Crosswind risk
Rain	Runway conditions
Cloud cover	VFR issues
Thunderstorm	Cancellation risk
6. “Prediction” – Keep it SIMPLE (Beginner-Friendly)
❗ Important truth

You DO NOT need AI or ML for this project.

✅ Use Rule-Based Scoring System (Best for beginners)

Example logic:

If visibility < 3000m → high risk
If wind speed > 20 knots → medium risk
If thunderstorm present → high risk
If heavy rain → medium risk


Then calculate a risk score.

Simple Scoring Example
Condition	Score
Good weather	+0
Moderate issue	+1
Severe issue	+2

Then:

0–2 → Likely to operate ✅

3–4 → Possible delay ⚠️

5+ → High risk ❌

👉 This is easy, explainable, and impressive in evaluation.

7. Alternate Airport Logic (Your BEST IDEA 💡)

This is where your project becomes unique.

Example:

KTM → BIR
Alternate: Bhadrapur

Backend logic:

Fetch weather for:

Kathmandu

Biratnagar

Bhadrapur

Calculate risk for each

If destination risk is high BUT alternate is good → show:

“Diversion possible but alternate weather favorable”

🔥 This shows aviation understanding, not just coding.

8. Backend (FastAPI) – What You Actually Build
API Endpoints (Simple)
GET /weather-risk?origin=KTM&dest=BIR&alt=BDP

Backend Steps:

Convert airport → latitude/longitude

Call weather API

Extract required fields

Apply rule-based logic

Return JSON response

Example response:

{
  "origin": "Kathmandu",
  "destination": "Biratnagar",
  "alternate": "Bhadrapur",
  "risk_level": "Medium",
  "recommendation": "Possible delay",
  "details": {
    "visibility": "Low",
    "wind": "Moderate",
    "rain": "Present"
  }
}

9. Flutter App (Keep UI Simple)
Screens you need:

Home Screen

Select origin

Select destination

Select alternate

Result Screen

Risk indicator (color-based)

Weather summary

Simple explanation

UI Colors:

Green → Good

Yellow → Caution

Red → High Risk

10. Project Roadmap (Follow this strictly)
Phase 1 – Basics (Week 1–2)

Learn API calling in FastAPI

Fetch weather data

Test in Postman

Phase 2 – Logic (Week 3)

Implement rule-based scoring

Add alternate airport logic

Phase 3 – Flutter Integration (Week 4)

Connect Flutter to backend

Display data nicely

Phase 4 – Polish (Week 5)

Error handling

Loading animations

11. Disclaimer (VERY IMPORTANT)

Add this in your app:

“This app provides weather-based risk estimation only and does not represent official airline or airport decisions.”

This shows professionalism.
